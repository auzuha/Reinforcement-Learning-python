<h3>Welcome to the Q Learning Visualisation Tool!</h3>

<pre>
This tool allows you to visualise the training process of a Q-Learning algorithm, which is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm used to solve problems with a continuous state space and discrete action space. The visualisation shows the agent's exploration of the state space, as well as its learning of the optimal policy over time.
The tool is an attempt to replicate a well known beginner's tutorial example of reinforcement learning, a robot in a maze.
It allows you to visualise the agent's exploration of the state space as it learns the optimal policy to reach the goal.

To run the tool, type <b>python main.py</b> in your command prompt.
